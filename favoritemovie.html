    <h2>Cutting Diet</h2>
   
    <p>
      When most people set foot in a gym their main motivation is to lose weight. Although weightlifting can greatly amplify results, your diet is actually 75% of your results. Average calorie intake for a male performing physical exercise is about 3000 calories a day. If you think about losing weight it’s simple, just consume fewer calories than you burn. As a rule of thumb, you want to decrease your calorie intake by 15% bringing your intake to about 2550 calories a day. Not only is the amount of calories important, but the food from which you receive these calories. For example, at the cheesecake factory, one slice of cheesecake is 1300 calories… you are already at half of your daily intake. Cheesecake has a very low nutrient density, which means very many calories for very little nutrients. You want to eat healthier foods and track your macronutrients. Proportionally, of your daily calorie intake, 60% should be carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 20% fat. Ideally, you would meal prep to plan out your meals according to the percentages and have a variety of foods that are of high nutrient density. According to Van De Walle, Gavin an example of a days meal plan would consist of:
     
      <h2>Meals</h2>       
      <aside style="border: dotted; padding: 10px; width: 50%; float: right;">
        As you can see all of the meals contain a primary source of protein, fat, and carbs. For example, breakfast consists of eggs, muchrooms and oatmeal. Eggs are a good source of protein (helps repair muscles) as well as fat (slow digesting, long run energy), which is paired with mushrooms (keeps body running optimally) in order to get vital vitamins and nutrients. Then there is oatmeal which is carbohydrate (main energy source) based and is the main macronutrient.

    <h2>Bulking Diet</h2>
    <p>
     In the bulking phase the main goal is to put on muscle mass and strength. While performing the main compound lifts, it is ideal to lift heavy. The sets and reps can vary depending on what lifting program you choose, but you normally want to stay below 6 repetitions. Sets and reps can range anywhere from 6 sets by 6 reps, all the way down to 6 sets by 1 rep. There are also methods where the weight changes every set depending on how many reps you are doing and the weight is calculated based on a percentage of your one rep max. Compared to cutting, repetitions while your are bulking are cut down because excess calories give you the extra energy needed to exert more energy. You cannot build muscle by lifting the same weights every day. By lifting heavier and heavier each week it shocks the muscles and that is what promotes growth. Long story short, there are many ways to lift while in the bulking phase of bodybuilding but the main goal is to lift heavy during your compound lifts and build strength. Then for your isolated lifts, the sets and repetitions can vary but it is most common to follow what I suggested while cutting and stick with higher repetitions.
