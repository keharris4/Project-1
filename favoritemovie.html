    <h2>Inglorius Basterds</h2>
   
    <p>
      Unlike mac n cheese, Inglorius Basterds has not been my favorite movie for a long time. This is because it is not suitable for children to watch. However, I do not like Inglorius Basterds because of the gore and killing that takes place. I appreciate the movie because of the characters and intensity of some scenes. My favorite character is Lt. Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt. What make Lt. Aldo Raine such a memorable character is his accent and don't care attitude. One of the most intense moments of the film, and one of my favorites, happens right at the beginning of the film where Nazi interregate a man and force him to point out the Jews he is hiding in his own house. A wave of dispair washes over the man as he feels he has betrayed his friends. Some people do not care for the movie due to the character speaking multiple languages, however I believe it adds to the realism of the movie.
