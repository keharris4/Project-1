    <h2>Cutting Workout</h2>
    <p>
      Within the cutting phase of bodybuilding, it is key to focus on compound lifts. This means while performing the lift you are triggering multiple muscles. A good example of this is the squat. The squatâ€™s primary focus is on the glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings (AKA your butt and thighs), but also engages the core, back and many other muscle groups. Isolation exercises are not bad but should be limited. When performing the exercises, four sets is usually a good benchmark. Some bodybuilding exercises can go up to ten sets, such as German volume training, but the norm/ basic workout is 4 sets. Now onto the reps. Within the four sets, the reps can vary. Bodybuilding.com is a great website to gain insight on bodybuilding techniques. According to bodybuilding.com the golden range is 8-12 reps but can exceed 20. 8-12 reps is the golden range because according to Young sub Kwon, M.S. and Len Kravitz, Ph.D., it has increased muscle hypertrophy. It allows the muscles to get good time under tension, increased volume and allows the muscles to come close to failure on each set. Now what does that all mean? So time under tension is taken literally, it is the time your muscles are under tension lifting the weights. Volume is simply the multiplication of weight you are lifting by the repetitions you are doing. With a combination of TUT and volume, you enlarge your muscles. Weightlifting causes micro-tears in the muscle fibers, and by consuming protein your body can engage in protein synthesis that repairs the muscle fiber and builds the muscle bigger and stronger than before.

    <h2>Bulking Workout</h2>
    <p>
      In the bulking phase the main goal is to put on muscle mass and strength. While performing the main compound lifts, it is ideal to lift heavy. The sets and reps can vary depending on what lifting program you choose, but you normally want to stay below 6 repetitions. Sets and reps can range anywhere from 6 sets by 6 reps, all the way down to 6 sets by 1 rep. There are also methods where the weight changes every set depending on how many reps you are doing and the weight is calculated based on a percentage of your one rep max. Compared to cutting, repetitions while your are bulking are cut down because excess calories give you the extra energy needed to exert more energy. You cannot build muscle by lifting the same weights every day. By lifting heavier and heavier each week it shocks the muscles and that is what promotes growth. Long story short, there are many ways to lift while in the bulking phase of bodybuilding but the main goal is to lift heavy during your compound lifts and build strength. Then for your isolated lifts, the sets and repetitions can vary but it is most common to follow what I suggested while cutting and stick with higher repetitions.
