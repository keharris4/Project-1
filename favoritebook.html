    <h2>Principles by Ray Dalio</h2>
    <p>
      I recently got done reading this book a few weeks ago and I throughly enjoyed it. It was the first book I have picked up in a long time and I surprised myself by how quickly I was able to finish it. The first part of the book is an autobiography of sorts in which Ray Dalio details his life up until present day. What I enjoyed about Ray Dalio's perspective of his life is that he did not just include rosy moments that made his life seem perfect, but rather he included moments of vulnerability and struggle. The majority of the book are principles that he found useful in his work and life. It sounds rather boring but can be really insightful on how to view and accomplish goals.
