      Bodybuilding has been around since 1876 and is appealing to many people. Bodybuilding is a sport in which an individual performs physical activity to sculpt oneâ€™s body by strengthening and growing their muscles. Bodybuilding is still being researched as there are many theories on the best ways to bodybuild, though there are three key factors to achieving your ideal physique: diet, workout program, and supplements. If you want more in depth information about bodybuilding I highly suggest checking out <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/">Bodybuilding.com</a>

      The two main stages of bodybuilding are bulking and shredding. In the bulking phase of bodybuilding the main goal is to gain weight and use that caloric surplus to lift heavy and gain strength. Then there is the cutting phase where the goal is to loose weight and maintain muscle mass while loosing fat. While bulking or cutting there are strict diets to follow and intense training programs that must be utilized in order to maximize results. You can read more about this in the "diet" and "workout" links above.
    <p>
      The last major component of maximizing bodybuilding results is by using supplements. The major categories of supplements are pre- workouts (ex. stim, pump, and focus), and post- workouts (ex. protein powder, BCAAS, and creatine). Pre- workouts are taken before your workout which stimulate the brain and increase blood flow in order to maximize endurance. Post- workout is taken after your workout which increases protein synthesis in order to maximize strength and recovery. To learn more about supplements go check out the "supplements" tab above.
